# Backend Roadmap 

## Listing what I know about the domain 
## What is Backend Engineering as per my knowledge ? OR What do I mean when I say Backend Engineering ?
1. There are two aspect to a software engineering project mostly
1. There are can one too 
1. Those are categorised by 
	1. Frontend Engineering 
	1. Backend Engineering 
1. Frontend Engineering involves with working of the user facing part or we could call it as User Interface 
1. Backend Engineering involves with working on the logic that executes when the user perform some action on the User Interface 
1. Backend Engineering can also more classified based on which part of the component that you are working for 
1. Which component are there in the backend engineering?
	1. Web Servers 
	1. Database 
	1. Client-Side 
	1. API
1. What are the domain that I think is necessary?
	1. Networking 
	1. Security 
	1. Cryptography 
	1. Database 
	1. Distributed Systems 
	1. Cloud Related Things 
	1. Container
1. There are different sub-domain that I can choose to work in Backend Engineering 

## Topics that is necessary for a Backend Engineer
1. API
1. Proxies
1. Load Balancer 
1. Database & Caching
1. Content Delivery Network 
1. Programming Language 
I'll be using Golang for this learning process
